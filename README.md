# Projet-lotto
     
```console
Bingo lotto is my first application made with the Python django framework.
It is an application for sports betting in which you have to choose between numbers ranging from 1 to 90 and then place a bet on these numbers.
If you are lucky enough to find two winning numbers among those that you have chosen then you win according to your initial bet.
```
